  "narrative":"The 'dimTrim' method is used to remove training and leading dimensions of length 1 from a tensor.\n    This is useful when you want to perform operations on tensors of different ranks.\n    For example, if you want to perform a dot product on two vectors, you can use the 'dimTrim' method\n    to remove the dimension of length 1 from the vector, so that it becomes a scalar.\n    This way you can perform the dot product on two scalars.",
