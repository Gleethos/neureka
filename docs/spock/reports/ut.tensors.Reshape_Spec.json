  "narrative":"This specification demonstrates how to reshape tensors,\n    which means to change the shape of a tensor.\n\n    Note that immutability is a core concept of the Neureka library.\n    This means that the `Tensor` API does not expose mutability directly.\n    Instead, it exposes methods that return new instances of `Tensor`\n    that are derived from the original instance.\n\n    This is also true for reshaping operations.\n\n    Don't be concerned about the performance implications of this,\n    because in the vast majority of cases the new instance will be backed by the same data array\n    as the original instance!",
