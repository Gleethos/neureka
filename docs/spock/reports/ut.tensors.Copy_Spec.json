  "narrative":"In this specification we cover the behaviour of tensors with respect to their copy methods.\n    There are to main ways to copy a tensor: <br>\n    1. .shallowCopy() <br>\n    2. .deepCopy() <br>\n    <br>\n    The first method creates a new tensor with the same underlying data array as the original tensor. <br>\n    The second method on the other hand creates a new tensor with a new data array. <br>\n    <br>\n    The first method is the most efficient, but it is not as safe as the second method. <br>\n    The second method is the most safe, but it is not as efficient. <br>\n    <br>\n    Besides these 2 main requirements, there are als some corner cases with respect to\n    the components of a tensor (like for example its computation graph) which\n    will be covered in this specification as well.",
