  "narrative":"Reshaping a tensor means changing its shape.\n    This is a very important operation in Neureka, because it allows for the creation of new views on the same data.\n    This is very useful for example when you want to perform a matrix multiplication on a tensor which is not a matrix.\n    In this case you can reshape the tensor to a matrix and then perform the multiplication.\n\n    Reshaping a tensor is also very useful when you want to perform other kinds of linear\n    operations like for example doing 4D convolution with a tensor which is not a 4D tensor.\n    In this case you can create a reshape 4D tensor then perform the convolution.\n\n    Reshaping is also a very cheap operation because it does not copy any data but merely\n    creates a new view on the same data with a different access pattern.",
