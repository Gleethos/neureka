  "narrative":"There are two fundamental categories of operations\n    which can be applied to tensors : \n    Inline operations and Non-Inline  operations! \n\n    Inline operations are often times problematic because they produce\n    side effects by changing passed tensors instead of producing new ones... \n    One such bad side effect can easily occur for tensors involved in the\n    autograd system, more specifically: the recorded computation graph. \n    Inline operations can break the mathematically pureness of the back-propagation\n    procedure by for example changing partial derivatives... <br>\n    In order to prevent said errors from occurring unnoticed tensors\n    have versions which will increment when the underlying data of the tensor changes. \n    This version will be tracked by the computation graph as well in order to\n    match it with the ones stored inside the tensor. \n    A mismatch would then yield an exception! \n\n    This specification is responsible for defining the behaviour of this\n    version number with respect to their wrapping tensors as well as computation graph nodes.",
