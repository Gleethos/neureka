            What are devices?
        </h3>
        <p class="MarkdownMe">
One core concept of Neureka is the `Device` interface which
provides a useful abstraction for a multitude of backends.<br>
Implementations of this interface represent
devices which primarily store tensors and might also be
capable of executing operations on them.<br>
<br>
Such instances are also components of tensors, which is why
the interface extends the `Component`&lt;`Tensor`&lt;`ValueType`&gt;&gt; interface. <br>
(For more information simply browse through the source code!) <br>
<br>
The device interface extends the `Storage` interface because devices
are also capable of storing tensors on them.
A tensor stored on a device holds a reference to that device,
as well as the device itself which also knows about the tensors it holds.
A tensor stored on a device will have its `isOutsourced` property set to true!
