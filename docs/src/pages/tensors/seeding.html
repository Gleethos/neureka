            Stringed seeding:
        </h3>
        <p>
            Pseudo randomness can be achieved by using seeds.
            Strings are a good source of randomness when hashed, which is what
            Neureka does internally to produce new random numbers distributed around 0.
            When a seed is being passed to the constructor of a tensor
            it will serve as a source of randomness used to fill this new tensor
            instance with values.
            Equal strings will produce the same values.
