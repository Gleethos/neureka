            Neural networks can usually be read from left to right.
            One of the simplest neural network as seen in this illustration is
            really just three vectors interconnected by 2 matrices. <br>
            These three vectors are also referred to as layers.
            In this case there is an input layer of the size 3 on the left
            end of the network, a so called 'hidden' layer of size 4 in the middle,
            and an output layer of size 2 on the right side. <br>
            As already said, these layers are vectors, consequently the
            green circles on the image represent scalar values. <br>
            Now you might wonder what I mean by matrices...
            The tangled lines in between the three layers are the
            two matrices I was referring to at the beginning of this paragraph.
            In fact every single line connecting two circles represents
            also just a single scalar value. This value is being referred to
            as "scalar weight", whereas the entire matrix is called "weight matrix"!

            If you don't know what a matrix multiplication is I would encourage
            you to study this topic of linear algebra by yourself... <br>
            If however you are already familiar with the core concept
            then I would like you to look at the following overview of a
            simple matrix multiplication in various notations : <br>

            Figure 2 <br><br>

            Outlined above is the multiplication of a 2x3 matrix with a 3x1 matrix (a.k.a a vector) !<br>
            The result of this operation is yet another vector, namely a vector with the length 2, <br>
            or depending on the point of view one might see it also as a matrix, a 2x1 matrix. <br>
            <br>

            Now you might be thinking : "It's all just matrix multiplications?" <br>
            And that is not entirely true! I have not yet revealed an important
            detailed that really captures the essence of the <b>neural</b> in "neural network" !<br>
            What I am referring to is the so called "activation function", which is
            important because of it's <b>non linearity</b>. <br>
            <br>
            Let's take a look at the structure of a single neuron :

            So what does a really neuron do? <br>
            Well first, it adds up the value of every neurons from the previous column it is connected to.
            On the Figure 3, there are 3 inputs (a1, a2, a3) coming to the neuron,
            so 3 neurons of the previous column are connected to our neuron.
            This value is multiplied, before being added, by another variable called
            “weight” (w1, w2, w3) which determines the connection between the two neurons.
            Each connection of neurons has its own weight, and those are the only values that
            will be modified during the learning process. <br>
            So what happens formally the calculation of the dot product between
            the vector (a1, a2, a3) and (w1, w2, w3) ! <br>
            Let's overview this : <br>
            <br>
            (a1, a2, a3) . (w1, w2, w3) = ( a1*w1 + a2*w2 + a3*w3 ) = ( i1 + i2 + i3 ) <br>
            <br>
            This concept above gives birth to reason why we use matrices to describe
            this process happening between layer! <br>
            To pu it simply : A matrix multiplication is merely
            calculating the vector of multiple dot products. <br>
            So every neuron input is simply the dot product of a matrix row
            with the vector of previous layer output. <br>
            <br>
            Note : <br>
            A important value which is not included in this illustration is the so called
            "bias"!<br>
            This value may be added to the total input calculated for every neuron.
            (Meaning :  "a vector of biasis for every input vector of a layer...") <br>
            This value is also learned alongside the weights. It stabilizes the network
            by providing a kind of "default / fallback state" for a neuron... <br>

            After all those summations, the neuron finally applies a function called
            “activation function” to the obtained value.<br>
            Then the neurons of the layer are successfully up to date!
