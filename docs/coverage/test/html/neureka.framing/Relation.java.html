/**
 *  This class is an important tensor component responsible for
 *  managing the relationships between slices and the tensors from which
 *  they have been derived.
 *  In case a tensor is a slice then it will have a Relation instance as
 *  component which will reference the parent tensor strongly (so that its data will not be lost).
 *  However in case a tensor is the &quot;parent&quot; of a slice tensor then it will
 *  contain a Relation instance which references the slices weakly (so that they can be garbage collected). &lt;br&gt;
 *  &lt;br&gt;
 *  Disclosure: The words &quot;children&quot; and &quot;parent&quot; are meant to be understood as
 *  references to the core concepts present within graph theory, &lt;br&gt;
