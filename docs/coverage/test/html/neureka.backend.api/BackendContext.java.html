/**
 *    Instances of this class are execution contexts hosting {@link Operation} instances which receive {@link neureka.Tsr}
 *    instances for execution.
 *    {@link BackendContext}s are managed by {@link Neureka}, a (thread-local) Singleton / Multiton library context.&lt;br&gt;
 *    Contexts are cloneable for testing purposes and to enable extending the backend dynamically.
 *    A given instance also hosts a reference to a {@link Functions} instance which exposes commonly used
 *    pre-instantiated {@link Function} implementation instances.
 *    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 *    The {@link BackendContext} initializes and stores {@link Operation} instances in various data structures
 *    for fast access and querying (Mostly used by the {@link ParseUtil} and {@link neureka.calculus.assembly.FunctionBuilder}).
 *    &lt;br&gt;
 *    {@link Operation}s are stored in simple list and map collections,
 *    namely: &lt;br&gt;
 *    The &quot;_instances&quot; list and the &quot;_lookup&quot; map as declared below.
 *    &lt;br&gt;
 *    &lt;br&gt;
 *    During class initialization concrete classes extending the {@link Operation} class
 *    are being instantiated in the static block below via a {@link ServiceLoader}.
 *    {@link BackendContext} instances expose a useful class called {@link Runner},
 *    which performs temporary context switching between the caller's context and this
 *    context during the execution of provided lambdas.
