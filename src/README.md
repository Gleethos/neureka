If you want to contribute to Neureka or merely 
take a look at it in your IDE of choice consider the following 
tips with respect to formalities and the 
dependencies on which Neureka is built : <br>

- Code quality is very important, therefore take a look at the `README.md` in `main/java` for the code convention rules.
- Neureka relies on **Spock** as a testing framework which
is based on the philosophy of writing readable living documentation
in a BDD like structure
instead of plain old unit tests.
Read more about it [here](https://spockframework.org/) or visit the test suite
of this project to see Neureka in action.
(Also, there is a plugin for IntelliJ which does some nice syntax highlighting!)
