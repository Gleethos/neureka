If you want to contribute to Neureka or merely 
take a look at it in your IDEA of choice consider the following 
tips with respect to formalities and the 
dependencies on which Neureka is built : <br>

- Code quality is very important, therefore take a look at the `README.md` in `main/java` for the code convention rules.
- Neureka relies on **Spock** as a testing framework, there is a plugin for IntelliJ which does some nice syntax highlighting!
