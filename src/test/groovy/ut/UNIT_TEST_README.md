# Unit Tests #

Tests within this package should only test <br>
code located in a single class where dependencies <br>
to other classes within this project are either non-existent <br>
or said classes are extremely simple ( Value / Record / Utility classes ) <br>
and therefore almost certainly free of side effects.
