# Integration Tests #

The specifications within this package are tests which cover features which <br>
require multiple modules working together to form said features. <br>
This is in contrast to unit tests, which should cover only
as single module.

## What is a Unit? ##

The term **module** mentioned earlier
is commonly what's considered as a testable unit.
However, this project does not contain
highly independent modules in the traditional
sense, which is why the non-unit tests
otherwise found in this project are simply
more compute intensive tests.
