Neureka is a platform independent deep-learning library written in Java. 

  - Java, Kotlin, Groovy, Scala, Jython, JRuby...
 
  - OpenCL accelerated.

  - nd-arrays / tensors.

  - flexible tensor indexing and slicing.

## Tech ##

This library is being heavily inspired by [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch).
A powerful deep learning framework that combines
[dynamic computation](https://medium.com/@omaraymanomar/dynamic-vs-static-computation-graph-2579d1934ecf), performance and debugging freedom!

Popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and Tensorflow are heavy weight code bases
which often do not carry with them the benefits of *'write once run everywhere'*.
This is especially true for dedicated <b>Hardware</b>! 

[On the state of Deep Learning outside of CUDAâ€™s walled garden.](https://towardsdatascience.com/on-the-state-of-deep-learning-outside-of-cudas-walled-garden-d88c8bbb4342)

This is due to the fact that the backends of these frameworks have been written in nvidia's cuda and C++. 
Which means that even developers willing to compile for all platforms
would still be locked out of AMD and Intel Systems when it comes to performance.

For that reason Neureka is written in Java and OpenCl.
Although performance will certainly be impacted 
by this choice, modularity, uncomplicated cross platform deployment and ease of 
use are the benefits.
Additionally, the use of OpenCl theoretically should allow for
FPGA utilization.

In general, the JVM ecosystem currently plays an underwhelming role in the Deep-Learning community despite
the fact that it is among the most dominant platforms.

[What Java needs for true Machine / Deep Learning support.](https://medium.com/@hsheil/what-java-needs-for-true-machine-deep-learning-support-1571ffdbb594)

Neureka has been built for the JVM not for Java.

## Development - [![Commit activity 1 year](https://img.shields.io/github/commit-activity/y/Gleethos/neureka.svg?style=flat)]() - [![Maintenance](https://img.shields.io/badge/Maintained%3F-yes-green.svg)](https://GitHub.com/Gleethos/neureka/graphs/commit-activity) - [![GitHub commits](https://img.shields.io/github/commits-since/Gleethos/neureka/v0.0.0.svg)](https://GitHub.com/Gleethos/neurka/commit/) ##

Want to contribute? Great!

Although present, the documentation on this project still needs to mature.
So if you have questions simply contact me or read through the test suite 
of this project to understand what Neureka is supposed to be!

Feedback is greatly appreciated!
